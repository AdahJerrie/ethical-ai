*Skills and improvement plans*

1. Problem decomposition          3/5    I plan to start breaking down roblems myself and attending to them without the interference of AI.

2. Systems Thinking        2/5     If I am able to decompose the problem, then figuring out how components interact will be easier for me.

3. Critical Evaluation         3/5     I plan to do more hands on projects by myself thereby familiarizing myself with codes, which will make it easier for me to know when code is wrong or inefficient.

4. Debugging mindset        3/5      I ususally try to investigate errors on my own before resorting to AI. I will improve on this, to make sure I can Identify common errors.

5. Conceptual Understanding      2/5       I basically just focus on how it works without knowing why! I will starting researching and asking questions more, to get full knowledge of basic concepts.



My lowest rated skill:  SYSTEMS THINKING
*3 actions I'll take withou relying on AI*

1. For every problem I am faced with, I will try to understand the various components needed to make it work efficiently. By problem decomposition it will help me point out easily the components involved.

2. I will also ensure I understand deeply the functionalities of the various components. This is to ensure I don't use libraries or other components blindly.

3. I will dedicate more time to knowing why than just knowing how! This will properly ground my understanding of the concepts rather than just cramming codes.
