*What I learned about AI and self reliance!*

From this brief discuss, It has become clear to me that I must see the emergence of AI as a tool to assist me in achieving my goal, and not as a replacement for my own work or my own intelligence. I have learned that as a developer that will be irreplaceable, I must not over rely on AI. There are basic concepts that I must not neglect, I will try on building on these concepts more while avoiding over reliance on AI.

IN future quests, my plan is to bury my head and learn the fundamentals for every concept, attempt every problem myself based on what I've learned and what I am learning, rather than jumping straight to consulting AI. I will break every problem down and start tackling them, AI will be my last resort. I plan on minimizing the use of AI in critical parts of my coding journey, and focusing on the basics.
