*My personal rules for ethical AI use in learning*

    *I will not use AI when*
    1. I must now henceforth attempt every question myself, the advantage here is that if I'm correct it's a plus, If I'm wrong I learn and try again. But the knowledge gotten in this approach sticks with me permanently. 
  
    2. I must first understand why something works and how it works, the concept behind every problem, with this when I apply the use of AI, it won't lead me off course.

    3. After trying my best, I will only resort to AI when I want to explore alternative approaches and maybe sort out other best practices and approach to give a more efficient output.

    *I will not use AI when*
    1. I will not use AI as my first go to after encountering a problem. Once I encounter a problem, my first approach will now be to break the problem down by pseudocode, the attempt the problem myself.

    2. while taking on a test or an assessment, I will not implore the use of AI. Because using AI in this kind of scenario kills totally the aim of the assessment or test, and it also makes me myself not to know my strength or weakness. Meanwhile tests and assessments are made to bring out what I can or cannot do and make me go and improve.

    3. As a developer there is a certain point where using AI makes me loose grip of core concepts. Now that I am still trying to catch the fundamental concepts, I will not rely on AI use. I will focus more on knowing and applying the knowledge in the little way I can.

    *I will only use AI fairly when*
    1. That point where I can now explain my code not through cramming, but through understanding of all the concepts fully without the help of AI, then I can ask AI for a different approach or modifications.

    
    2.For any problem that I want to ask for AI's assisstance, I must first of all be able to attempt similar problems on my own. I won't rely on AI if my ability to solve that particular problem is zero. 
    
    
    3. When my confidence level must have increased and I can now solve any problem relating to that independently, then I can use AI to speed up some processes. Because I have attained some level of understanding I can now ask AI for some assisstance.
